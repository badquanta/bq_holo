# `bq::holo`

Protodeck is just me messing around with ideas for a game-engine.
This version is based on the  "Entity-Component-Systems" design;
with class-names taking inspiration from "Star Trek's holodecks."

### 0.  _E.C.S._  __term__  == `holo::`...  __class__
 
 _followed by a description_
 
 1. _World_  == `holo::Grid`
 
> An instance of the `holo::Grid`	is the same as a instantiated  _E.C.S._  "World"; basically a container of at least: a "System Manager", a "Component Manager", and a "Entity Manager." (A.K.A.: `holo::Protocol`, `holo::Arch`, `holo::Base`)
 
 2. _Component_ == `holo::Field`
 
> E.C.S. components are bits of data that can	 	be associated with any Entity(`holo::Gram`s.)
 
 * _Entity_ == `holo::Gram`
 
> E.C.S. "Entities" represent atomic units that have (zero or more) properties.  This is the same of a `holo::Gram`; or rather it is the "atomic" unit of something that exists; with "Bases" representing
the properties this "atomic" unit possesses.
 
 * _System_ == `holo::Protocol`

> E.C.S. defines a "System" to be an operation 

 * _System Manager_ == `holo::Program`
 * _Entity Manager_ == `holo::Arch`
 * _Component Manager_ == `holo::Emitter`
